Maybe this global pessimism is the result of a culture bathed in bad news, or maybe we inherently know the earthshaking truth presented at the heart of this book: Something is deeply wrong with our planet, and we are powerless to fix it.",

In this astonishing work you will discover that evil has a face, good has a Champion, and sin has an end. If you want to prepare for the end of this world and the glorious world to come, you must read this book."
